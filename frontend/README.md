NodusOperandi web front end
===========================

Introduction
------------
The NodusOperandi web front end is (currently) built on Zend Framework 2.  Manual installation of this code is done in the
usual manner for a ZF2 application, however we recommend using the appropriate installer for your operating system as it will
ensure that all dependencies are installed and set up correctly for you.
